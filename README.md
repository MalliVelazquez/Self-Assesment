# Self-Assesment

## What I Have Accomplished?

I have taken many courses. If I have always been proud of something, it is that I 
have never stopped studying. But this course and especially this project has been 
another level of difficulty.

For this project my main role was the organization and homogenization of the folders 
in Github, however I also dedicated myself to answering some of our main questions 
and creating the visualization of it in our dashboard.

For me, the biggest challenge I faced in this project was managing my colleagues
time to coordinate meetings and explain progress so that we were all on the same 
line of knowledge.

My colleagues have been wonderful and always did their part to achieve all our goals.

Thanks to them we managed to create a fairly effective communication network, we created 
an external WhatsApp group from day 1 and we had two meetings at the beginning and at the 
end of the week in addition to time in class to be able to move forward and always have 
the changes up to date. Each one for his part had separate meetings with the colleague who 
had a step backwards or forwards to continue with our part of the work. We were always 
helping each other so that the rubrics were covered.

For this project we analyzed the data of a dairy farm to obtain productivity answers that 
were requested by the owner of the same. We used a Random Forest model to predict which 
cows would be profitable for the next lactation cycle. Based on this and on the initial 
data, we were able to create graphs that detail total production and details of the cows 
currently alive, which gives them a clear vision to improve their veterinary, productive 
and internal logistics strategies.

So yes, so far, this have been an amazing trip. I have never been so thankful to teachers 
and team for the support and well disposition. I am a faithful believer that we need a good 
team to achieve our goals and this project has shown me that I am right.
